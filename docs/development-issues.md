## Issue 1: Ornament Position Modifications Not Working

### Problem
Multiple attempts to modify ornament positioning using `attachmentAnchor` and `contentAlignment` showed no visible changes. Changed from `.bottom` to `.leading`, `.top`, etc. - nothing worked.

### What We Discovered
We were modifying the wrong ornament. The visible bottom buttons were actually from `.toolbar`, not `.ornament`.

### The Confusion
```swift
// This is what we saw (bottom buttons)
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .bottomOrnament) {
        Button("Commands") { }
        Button("Network") { }
    }
}

// This is what we were modifying (hidden panel)
.ornament(
    visibility: showQuickCommands ? .visible : .hidden,  // Hidden!
    attachmentAnchor: .scene(.bottom),
    contentAlignment: .top
) {
    quickCommandsOrnament
}
```

We spent hours modifying the hidden ornament while the visible buttons were from toolbar.

### Solution: UIHostingOrnament
User suggested using UIHostingOrnament instead of SwiftUI ornament modifier. This worked because:

```swift
let ornament = UIHostingOrnament(
    sceneAnchor: .bottom,
    contentAlignment: .top  // User's key insight: .top moves it up from bottom
) {
    HStack(spacing: 12) {
        Button("Commands") { }
        Button("Network") { }
    }
    .padding(12)
    .background(.regularMaterial, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))
}

self.ornaments = [ornament]
```

Required UIViewControllerRepresentable to bridge SwiftUI and UIKit.

### What We Learned
1. Always check what UI element you're actually modifying
2. SwiftUI ornament modifier has limitations
3. UIHostingOrnament provides better control
4. `contentAlignment: .top` with `sceneAnchor: .bottom` moves ornament up from bottom edge
